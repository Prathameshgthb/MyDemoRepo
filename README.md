# MyDemoRepo
This is the first Repository that I have created on GitHub. It will be used for practice purpose only.

This is second line which is inserted into READE File through Visual Studio.

git restore - to discard changes in working directory.

First you need to set Author Identity:
git config --global user.email "your emailid"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
