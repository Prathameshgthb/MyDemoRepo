# MyDemoRepo

This is the first Repository that I have created on GitHub. It will be used for practice purpose only.

This is second line which is inserted into READE File through Visual Studio.

This line is inserted into the README File using the branch method. First A branch was created by the name of "FirstBranch" and then the user switched to the newly created branch using the command 'git checkout -b <branch name>'. In this way the new branch was activated.
