$git add <Filename1>  <Filename2>
$git commit -m "<Comment>"
$git push 

NOTE: To add all changes in various different files use '$git add ."
NOTE: To add & commit in one same line use - '$git commit -am "<Comment>"

TO CHECK STATUS OF REMOTE & LOCAL SYSTEM REPOSITORY:
$git status

TO CREATE NEW BRANCH & MERGE IT WITH MAIN BRANCH:
$git checkout -b "<NewBranchName>"
$git branch --- To see which branch you are working in.
(After making changes in your newly created branch)
$git commit -am "<Comment>"
(If you try to push the changes it wont work because the newly created branch does not exist in Git; it only exists in your Local System. Follow -)
